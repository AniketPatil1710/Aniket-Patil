Que1)
Write a program to take a 2 dimensional array of m rows and n columns and print the addition of the main diagonals and if the sum is even then print the transpose of matrix.(note:m and n must be the same.)

Output:
12 14 16
21 24 26
06 18 10
[Main diagonal elements]:12 24 10

Main diagonal elements addition is:46 

Transpose of matrix:
12 21 06
14 24 18
16 26 10
