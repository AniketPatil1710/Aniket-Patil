Que1)

In the above code, we have performed the post decrement operation on t he variable
val which is initializes to 1,and hence internally a function which peforms the post decrement,
eg.int post(val){.//post(1)
int temp;
temp=val//temp=1;
val=val-1;//val=0;
return temp;//return 1;
}

add from above snippet the value gets returned as 1 and so the condition for if
block gets false nd so else block gets
executed

and hence thhe current answer is True.


Que2)

Usually break statement is used to come out from a looping block of execution for instance for-loop,while-loop,do-whileloop etc.

but in above snippet we are using it inside a if-else block which is not a looping tatement since it will only get executed once,

and hence the compiler wil throw error as "Break statement not within a loop or switch"

Que3)

every number other than zero is considered as true.
 So all conditions if statement are true ,
 so if block executed.
So option A iscorrect

Que4)
whenever we dont enclose thhe if block within curly-brace, only one statement is consideredas a part of if-block,
so printf("1") is part of if bock,
second printf("2") is cosidered as independent statement
but when compiler read the else statement it will look up corresponding if-block to that else but right above if compiler will get a individual'
print statement it will look up for correspondence with the above that printf and hence it will give the error.
simply,we can't use any statement between if and else blockotherwise
compiler gives error


Que5)

if(pn>20){//100>20 => Condition is true.

if(pn<20)// 100>20 => Condition is false so else will get executed

else
	printf("Hiiiii")

	so option B


Que6)

L suffix indicates long int. and long requires 8 bytes.
10L will be stored in memory like below,
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010

 10 is of integer type it requires 4bytes 10 willl be stored in memory like below

 0000 0000 0000 1010

 both 10L and 10 are same and so if condition will return true ,
 So ans is 10L


Que7)

Here  a=500 the precedance of relational operators if higher than hat of logical operators,
So first a>=400 will get checked and then logical not operator will work
here, the vale of a(500) id greater than 400 so the statement becomes true
i.e.!(True)
Negation of rue is false and so if statement will return false and b will not get assigned new value .
So answer is d correct

Que8)

0.7 is considered as double value,
and in internal representation of 0.7(double) value is greter than that of 0.7(float)value.
so if statement returned true s option a is correct

Que9)

if(!(!x) && x){
     //(!(x)&&x))
    //(!(false && true) non zero numberis true 
     //(!(false))
     so condition becomes true 
      option c is correct
     
~
