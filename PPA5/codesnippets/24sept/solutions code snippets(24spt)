Que1)
Here we have called the function by passing address of array, which technically is correct as the receiver/parameter is a potential pointer and when we are changing the value at second index in arr , but as arr in function is nothing but reffernce of arr in function is nothing but reference of arr in main , the value in main gets changed. and hence option a is correct answer.

Que2)
To initialize array with initializer list we use curli-braces instead of square brackets and so it"s an invalid syntax and hence we get compile time error.

Que3)
alphabets[5] is out of bound in array. Accessing outside the bounds of the array will simply access another part of the already allocate stack space.

Que4)
at adress arr-1 and arr +3 we did not assign any value . All the unitializer static variables in BSS have default value zero.

Que5)
we can't use increment and decrement operator on memory operator on memory adress . Because it try to change memory adress.

Que6)
adress=(adress)+(number*sizeof datatype = 4 &Core2web represent adress of hole array hence size of datatype =16
