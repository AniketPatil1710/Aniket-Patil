Que1)
Here we declare an const array of integers and an integer pointer.
while assining the value to ptr we assign an address of an 3rd elemet from array
arr=100
&(arr+3)=112

ptr=112
so we change value to that adress so it also assign to that const array because here thevalue i that array are consrtant address are not constant so we can access that and change the value to that address
So in above code it gives the value which we assign to that pointer.

Que2)
arr[4]=5
arr[i]=arr[2]=3
arr[j]=arr[5]=6
.......
arr[4%i]=arr[0]=1

Que3)
Negative index for an array is allowed in an C programming

this code is compiled but gives an garbage value
arr=100
arr[-2]=(100-2*4)=100+(-8)=92

because it points to the previous adress which is not part of array

Que4)
Default value assign to an uninitialised local array is garbage value & default value assign to an uninitialised global array is 0
so in above code global array print all 0, and local array prints all garbage value.

Que5)
garbage value is the default value to the uninitialised local array
but arrray in partial initializers then local array store those garbage value as 0

so in above code the first two values of an array ar 10,11 and others are 0

Que6)
initialy i=4 so while loop executed

while i=4 value of j=garbage value because 4 is out of array index
while i=3 value of j=16+3=19
....
while i=1 value of j=4+1=5
while i=0 loop terminates

so output of above  code is 5

Que7)
code will executes without n error 

the condition of an while loop is given as an array elements
so initially

while arr[0]=4 then sum =4
while arr[1]=2 then sum=4+2=6
while arr[2]=6 then sum=6+6=12
while arr[3]=0loop trminates

0 is the termination condition of an array

so the output is sum=12

Que8)
---

Que9)
final sum will be 70
