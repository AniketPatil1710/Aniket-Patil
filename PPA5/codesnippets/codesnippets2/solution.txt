Core2web because in switch if any condition is true
 or false default get executed if other case do not get 
 executed or other case are not provided
 hece answer is option c

Que2)
PPA Java Core2web because a=1 and case 1 gets executed 
but we have not given break statement after case so below case also 
get executed without checking the condition is true or false

Que3)

The answer is option C i.e M.GJohnson Mohamad Asif M.Murlidaran because check=2 and case 2
gets executed but we have not given break statement after case so below case also get executed
without checking the condtion is true or false

Que4)

The answer is option B Race because condition of switch is movie<<2+movie=1<<2+1=1<<3
and one leftshift three times is 1*2^3=8
so case 8 get executed and its the last case so we not providedbreak then also our output came as expected but 
if it was not was not last case so we not
provided break then also our output came as expected but if it was not last case then break would
be must so that only expected case should executed

Que5)

The answer is option B i.e Warren because condition in switch is comma separated
and it is evaluated from right to left so case L*2 i.e 20 get executed and also see here that L
is not a variable here it a macro which will be expnded in
preprocessing stage as case only contains integer not variable name

Que6)

The ans is D i.e compilation error because only integer can be in case 
label not other datatype or any variable name.And as char is stored initially name 
And as ascii so its by default int

Que7)

The answer ios option C i.e Casabance because the evalution of expression is
*(1+"AB" "CD"+1) = 1+"AB" "CD" = "BCD"+1  "CD" and *(CD)
 is first character of char * so case label is executed

Que8)

compiation error because semicolon is missing in the
 char *str="ONE" and char * cannot be case label

Que9)

The answer is option D i.e 1 because after evalution the statement 
a= a==b==0 i.e a=3==2==0 i.e a=0==0==0 therefore a stores 1 and in
sizeof(a++) only size of variable is calculated neither pre nor post
increent is evalutedand thus the of a is 1

Que10)

The answer is compilation error because of duplicate case in 

 case -~11 when evaluated gives 12 and case 6-3<<2on
 evvaluation produces 3<<2=3*2^2=12 so the cases are same 
 and switch do not accepts duplicate cases thus compilaion error
